As I regained confidence in my work and felt that I wanted to step into the art a little more, I had a great opportunity to talk to people who work with AI and art today.


After listening to them talk about the “phenomenon” of AI and art, such as copyright, I heard a lot of “insights” that I hadn't thought of before, and I think I have my own views.



The most memorable one was that AI algorithms themselves can be seen as interactive works of art, and that there are layers to AI development, and that an artist's contribution can be made depending on how much they can intervene in the layers (from the prompt to what generative model/deep learning technique to use, what to do with the data set, etc.)



So I think AI will eventually become an art medium.

No one can code these days, even babies are learning, and soon we will have a world where artists will naturally have coding knowledge to understand and edit basic AI structures.

Just like we do with Photoshop now.



I wonder if we will learn AI as one of the artistic mediums, just like we learn the types of solvent oils, pigments that shouldn't be mixed, and canvas stippling when dealing with oil painting.

So, if we decompose the layers of AI and create a code that produces the results that the artist wants according to his or her taste, can't it be seen as art itself and the result as well?



Let's say that art is largely composed of thought and action (implementation). Personally, I think that in the case of prompted image generation, neither the thought nor the execution is too small a part of the artist. Like photography, you don't think about the composition, you don't go to a specific place to take an image, and you don't pack your things.



Moreover, the data sets that are the basis for AI generation are all other people's images. When photography appeared, it was called art, but eventually it was recognized as the artist's thoughts and actions to press the shutter and compose the composition, and at least the camera was a mirror that transparently reflects the artist's thoughts rather than showing the work of others. 



Moreover, artwork is also important to tell a story/message, and even if the image fits the message, if the process of realizing the image is poor, the message will not be fully conveyed.

For example, can a rich artist's image of poverty using AI from a warm home move even a single person from the heart? 



However, if the AI itself is designed by an artist, and if it is used appropriately to express his or her thoughts, taking into account the characteristics of AI (it is not very good for the environment, it is highly dependent on the data set, there may be copyright issues...), I think it can be considered art.
