## Pulse ripple
<br>
Pulse Ripple is a interactive interface that transforms the user’s pulse signal into water ripples. 
This new interface depicts user interaction through intersecting water ripples created by the user’s pulse signals. 
Users n experience an engaging and immersive visual display as the Pulse Ripple generates constantly evolving water ripples in response to their pulse. 

The interaction is intuitive, starting with a simple touch of a fingertip on the sensor. This system can be adapted for various applications, such as public installations where multiple pulse sensors and magnetic balls create interactive displays for groups. It can also serve as an educational tool in museums, incorporating different sensor types like ultrasonic sensors to teach users about digital and analog signals. Additionally, Pulse Ripple is well-suited for meditation, allowing users to observe the rhythm of their heartbeat through water ripples, helping them interpret their physical and emotional state while providing a visually soothing experience.

The Pulse Ripple tank features an H-structure that separates water from the mechanical components. The upper section holds water while the lower houses the mechanics. A black sheet inside enhances the visibility of ripples, and the acrylic and wooden construction is reinforced with waterproofing and steel braces for stability. The magnetic balls, 3 cm half-cut spheres with neodymium magnets, are encased in urethane foam for buoyancy and secured with strings to maintain their position.

The system operates with pulse sensors, an Arduino, a motor driver, and DC motors. When users place a fingertip on the sensor, their heartbeat is detected and transmitted to the Arduino, which synchronizes the motor speed with their pulse. Spinning motors with neodymium magnets create alternating attraction and repulsion forces, moving the magnetic balls and generating water ripples. The interaction ends when the user removes their finger from the sensor.
