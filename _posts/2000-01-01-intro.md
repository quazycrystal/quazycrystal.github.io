<h3>Fine Art to Human Computer Interaction</h3>
My creative journey began in field of art, focusing on sound and kinetic installations. However, it became clear that artistic practice does not always translate into visible contributions to society. 
<br>

<h3>Design as a Response to Social Needs</h3>
Studying industrial design was a way to turn artistic vision into practical solutions for a better society. 
The Oxynizer: Sustainable & Non-electric Oxygen Generator project was a turning point, revealing how design inclusively respond to urgent needs. 
<br>

<h3>Systems for Better Society</h3>
Today, my practice focuses on creating purposeful systems through human-centered computing. I aim to bridge artistic exploration with social impact, advancing design and technology solutions rooted in inclusivity.
