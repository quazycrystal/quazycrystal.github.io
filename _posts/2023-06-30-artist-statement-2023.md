Artist Statement (2023)
</span>  

Most of my work consists of kinetic sculptures inspired by personal athletic experiences and meditative body movements. Through working out, I discovered how physical movement can profoundly impact the mind, leaving me mentally empowered. This realization echoes the dual meanings of the word “MOVE”—to change the place or position (of the body) and to evoke a strong feeling (of the mind). The transformation of body and mind occurs simultaneously through action, each following its own path yet deeply interconnected.  

My artworks come to life through viewer interaction, requiring physical engagement. This transforms the artistic experience into an emotional memory. The kinetic devices in my work sometimes act as extensions of the human body, while at other times they function as peculiar tools that prompt viewers to move in unexpected ways.  

I draw inspiration from fleeting sensory fluctuations, as if translating the complexity of a time-based graph into a tangible form. The physicality of materials is central to my creative process; the abstract visions of my work are brought to life only through carefully chosen materials. I consider texture, color, durability, and metaphor as integral elements, blending them in nuanced and intentional ways.  

Currently, I am exploring how environments perceived by the body influence both movement and mental states. Additionally, I am developing fictionalized creatures that inhabit imagined landscapes drawn from personal memories.  

My most recent work, < Sonus dasyatis >, extends my exploration of virtual life and environments. Its shimmering epidermis reflects changing colors depending on the light, while it emits varied sounds and illuminations in response to audience interaction. Like dolphins that communicate through ultrasonic waves, these creatures engage with the audience through sound and light, forming a dynamic dialogue between art and observer.
