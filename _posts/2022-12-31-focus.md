## Focus, 2022
<br>
FocusÂ embodies the essence of intense concentration. My experience of focus, which resembles switching on the light inside of me, was symbolized by the illuminated steel skull positioned at the center of the piece. 
<br>

This central skull-shaped element was meticulously crafted by stitching fine steel wires thousands of times onto steel mesh. The process demanded unwavering attention and precision, like counting each hole to achieve uniformity. The cold, metallic texture and the skeletal form collectively evoke an atmosphere of solemnity and introspection, reflecting the disciplined immersion toward work.
<br>

Surrounding the steel skull, translucent and gray layered panels encapsulate the dynamic energy of bold brushstrokes, representing the vigor of artistic focus. These circular brushstrokes create a contained aura that accentuates the central steel skull. This compositional arrangement naturally directs the viewer's attention toward the center, reinforcing the thematic focus of the piece.
