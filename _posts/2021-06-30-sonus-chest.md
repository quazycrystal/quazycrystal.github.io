## Sonus chest
<br>

< Sonus chest > is a MIDI instrument equipped with six touch sensitive ribbon surfaces. Similar to pressing frets on a guitar, the player produces sound by touching specific positions on the membrane potentiometers. Each ribbon corresponds to a different octave, allowing for a wide range of musical expression across up to six octaves. The instrument supports both sliding notes and chord playing.

Its most distinctive feature is the ability to perform smooth, guitar-like slide techniques. This design captures even subtle finger movements musically. A rotary encoder allows for semitone pitch adjustments across the entire instrument, while four rotary knobs are mapped to virtual instrument parameters for intuitive sound control. A toggle switch on the top controls NeoPixel lighting, with each pixel changing color in response to touch position, providing visual feedback during play.

Unlike conventional commercial MIDI guitars that imitate the form of a real guitar, Sonus Chest adopts a compact, minimalist design. Its kitschy, easily customizable exterior allows players to express their individuality. Measuring approximately 25.5cm × 19cm × 6cm and weighing around 300g, it’s small and lightweight enough for easy portability. The box-shaped body includes an attached lid, enabling safe storage without the need for an additional case. Inspired by the way people decorate their laptops, the lid offers a space where users can add stickers or decorations to personalize their instrument.

As a MIDI-based device, Sonus Chest is fully compatible with standard digital audio workstations (DAWs) used for music composition and performance, allowing users to freely configure sounds and harmonies via computer.
