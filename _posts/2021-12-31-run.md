## Run
<br>
< Run > reflects the personal experience of running. The refreshing sensation of moving dynamically against the wind provided significant emotional support. Focusing on this dynamism, the work was created inspired by the stamping motion of the feet.
<br> 

The work operates when a drum pedal is pressed. The force applied to the pedal is transmitted through two rods to the frame, causing the transparent structure to repeatedly contract and expand, generating diverse forms. White cable ties, densely interwoven in a snowflake-like pattern, both emphasize the trembling motion of the frame and evoke the brisk, clean quality of winter air.
<br> 

The overall sculpture consists of multiple, snowflake-shaped units connected together. To prevent the elements from interfering with one another’s movement, they are attached only at the joints rather than across the entire frame. Chains of cable ties extend beneath the structure and sway with each motion, further accentuating its dynamism. To distribute weight and ensure natural movement, the installation is suspended from the ceiling and walls with elastic fishing lines.
<br> 

The transparent PE pipe frame was inspired by Theo Jansen’s kinetic structures, in which leg movements vary according to pipe lengths. Through experiments with pipes of different sizes, the artist developed a new structural configuration. The main frame employed 50 cm and 25 cm pipes, later supplemented with 37.5 cm pipes to increase flexibility and create distinctive movements. A central triangular unit of 25 cm pipes stabilized the structure, enabling it to expand and contract smoothly under the pedal’s force without collapsing.
